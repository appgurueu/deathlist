# Kill History(`deathlist`)
A mod displaying a colored list of recent kills/deaths and the causes(killer, used item).

## About
Depends on [`modlib`](https://github.com/appgurueu/modlib) and - depending on your configuration - also other mods. If you use the default configuration, it depends on `default` and `fire`.
**If there are other mods registering `on_punchplayer` or `on_hp_change` handlers, add them to the dependency list to make sure they execute before `deathlist`.**
